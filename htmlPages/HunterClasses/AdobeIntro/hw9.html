<p>For the First Collage, I made a gif collage. I used a sky picture from the beach I went once and merged 2 layers to have a mirror effect. Each sky turns darker and less viberant when the figures circulate.I sketched the girl in photoshop, having frames of making her blink. I created the tv static using a black background and added noise and gradient from dark to white. I added shear to the layer and added a disort. Made varations to make it appear as it moved. For the colored TV I used an image of error it is a common creative photo. I turned that photo into a pattern and inserted that pattern within the girl's figure.</p>

<p>For the Second Collage, I made a simple collage. I used the met collection of most of this work. I aimed for a frame within the frame and the collection of memories. Each frame contains a memory and it almost a appears like they are portals to another world feel. I also added a sketch that I thought was interesting a woman who is peeking the frame within the frame aspect. I made a combination of blends, from subtract to pin light, and lighten features.Each picture inside the frames I took from different moments in my life, and the cat had an interesting pose so I made a glare to make it appear almost sinister looking but in an adorable way.</p></div>
