The film colors, I used Triad colors to the closest colors, I like. While the Tab version I aimed for warm colors. I used the adobe color website to understand and play around with the color wheel. At the film pattern I was not sure what to create and the colors were pretty odd to play with. I then decided to go for a bubbly look, I am a huge fan of bouncing bubbles. After grouping the circles it almost created a grape shape apperance. Later on, I thought the space was looked empty and decided to create blowing bubbles look, and realized I can make crecent moons. The second piece I was also indecisive and wanted a different variation as the first one. Instead of completely circles I went for squares. Kind of appears to be that 90s colors of warm colors. Pink/fushia type of color as the eye catching. The flimsy and Tv look was pretty interesting and added stars kind of flash aspect of it. Each work piece is more towards, the gift wrap side, since I think this type of design would be seen in a gift wrap section. The colors are pretty dark and not enough light.
