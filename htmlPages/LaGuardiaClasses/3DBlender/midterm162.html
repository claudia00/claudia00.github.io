<div class = "words"><p>I start with an airplane to bump the start of the dyanmic ball. I made several boards to interact with the dynamic ball. I made a quick sample with the pinball board. Then used a bellow air type of scientist feel to light up, a chemical that travels through the tube. Then the ball fills up, to jump to a platform to turn on a button. The button then triggers, a hand to turn on a phone. </p></div>
