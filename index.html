<p>Artist Statement and About Me</p>

<div class = "artistStatement">
	<div class ="profilePicture"><img src="profilePicArt.jpg"></div>
	<br></br>
	<p>No matter what medium the artist expresses in, you can always see their spirit in their work. This motive alone inspires to make my own message for the world to interpret. Many people ask me, well how do I get ideas, based from my experiences, and feelings at that one moment is what influences my creations. The way I often begin my work is through my excitement of the possibility of building a world. A place that is filled with my desires in a way, let me explain. With my constant influences of magic powers, hero's journey story to convey. If you ever had a blank canvas, piece of white paper, infinite amount of legos or even played minecraft in creative mode, you have this sensation of being an all powerful being, as a creator making everything and any possible.
I have to say, my biggest influences would be from video games and animated series. A game specifically called Kingdom Hearts that lets you be a hero saving these disney worlds.
	Animated series are pretty endless. There are way too many I fell in love with in their own individual worlds. Each series took me to a place filled with heroes, to characters finding love, to a journey to becoming a hero, all creative and amazing into making the worlds.
